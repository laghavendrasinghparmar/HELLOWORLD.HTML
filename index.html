    and behaving irresponsibly. The person who never .attempts anything is often a bigger mistakethan making the attempt and failing.
    Indecision is habit forming and contagious. Many opportunities are lost because of indecision.

When problems seem insurmountable, quitting may look like the easiest way out.
            It is true for every marrige, job, relationship also. Winners are struck but not destroyed.
        Most people fails not because they lack knowledgeor talent but because they quit. The total secret of success lies in two traits: persistance and resistance. <i>persist</i> in what must be done and <i>resist</i> from what ought not to be done.</p>

        from waking up to putting you to asleep. people want to take a pill to get rid of their problems. In same way when people wants to become a instant millonaires, they take shortcuts and compromise their integrity. Remember that when going to 
    pinstant gratifiacation one never thinks of consequences, only of momentary pleasures.<i>"when you thinks short term, not long term, it is a limited vision. With limited vision you will never see any worthwhile goals".</i></p>

    <div class="container"><p><strong><h4>Looking for shourtcuts-</h4></strong>There are two ways to getting rid in your own weeds in your yard: the easy way and not so easy way. The easy way may be to run a lawnmover; the yard looks fine for a while, but it is a temporary solution. soon the weeds are back. The not-so-easy way means getting down on your hands and knees and pulling out the weeds by the roots. It is time consuming and painfull,
    but tyhe weeds stay away for a longer time. The forst solution looks so easy, but the problem remained. The second solution was not so easy, but took care of the problem from the roots. The key is to get the root of the problem. The same is true of our attitudes in our life. the same is true of our attitudes in our life. Some people spread their attitudes of bitterness and resentments and these attitudes keep croping them in different aspects of their lives. </p>

    <div class="container"><p><strong><h4>Unwillingness to plan and prepare-</h4></strong><i>Everyone has a will to win but very few have the will to prepare to win this is the universal truth.most people spends there more time planning a party or vacations than planning their lives. <br>
    confidance comes from preparation, which is nothing but planning and practicing.</i> Winners put pressure on themselves. That is the pressure of preparing and not worrying about winning. If we practice poorly, we play poorly, because we play as we practice. The difference between success and failure is the difference between doing exactly right and almost right. A complete mental preparation is the result of sacrifice and self discpline. It is to be average but tough to be the best. No wonder the average people choose the easy way.
praparation is the necessary edge to succeed in any field.</p></div>
